## Problem Statement: Find the sum of cubes of each digit of the number that is equal to the number itself. ##

**John wants to develop a number game that will have numbers as below**

153 = ( 1 * 1 * 1 ) + ( 5 * 5 * 5 ) + ( 3 * 3 * 3 )

371 = ( 3 * 3 * 3 ) + ( 7 * 7 * 7 ) + ( 1 * 1 * 1 )

**The sum of cubes of each digit of the number is equal to the number itself. He needs
to have the numbers that are only between 1 to 500, and displays the count of only such numbers.**

## Example

#### Sample Input:

    StartValue = 1

    EndValue = 500

#### Expected Output :

    Total count of numbers::  = 4
